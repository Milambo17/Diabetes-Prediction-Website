          Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood
          sugar levels. It occurs when the body either does not produce enough
          insulin or does not effectively use the insulin it produces. People
          having diabetes have high risk of diseases like heart disease, kidney
          disease, stroke, eye problem, nerve damage, etc. 
          <p>According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), as of 2021, approximately 463 million adults (20-79 years) were living with diabetes worldwide.
            Diabetes prevalence is increasing globally, and it is estimated that by 2045, the number of people with diabetes will rise to 700 million.</p>
            <p>
            Type 2 diabetes accounts for around 90% of all diabetes cases.
            
            Uncontrolled diabetes can have a significant impact on quality of life and life expectancy.
            Lifestyle factors such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and obesity contribute to the increasing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes.
            Early diagnosis, effective management, and adopting a healthy lifestyle can help prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes.</p>
          It is a leading cause
          of death with approximately 4.2 million deaths attributed to diabetes
          in 2019.According to the International Diabetes Federation, as of
          2021, there were an estimated 527 million adults living with diabetes
          worldwide. Type 2 Diabetes accounts for about 90%of all cases of
          diabetes and it is largely preventable through lifestyle modifications
          and early detection and intervention. It also disproportionately
          affects low â€“ middle income countries, and the prevalence of diabetes
          is expected to continue to rise globally in the coming years. Machine
          Learning Algorithms will require large amounts of high-quality data to
          train the model accurately. Supervised learning algorithms can
          sometimes be biased towards the training data.

          <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
          <p>
            This type of diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the immune
            system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in
            the pancreas. It usually develops in childhood or early adulthood.
            People with Type 1 diabetes require insulin injections or the use of
            an insulin pump to manage their blood sugar levels.

          <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
          <p>
            Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for
            the majority of cases. It is often associated with lifestyle factors
            such as obesity, sedentary behavior, and poor diet. In Type 2
            diabetes, the body becomes resistant to insulin or does not produce
            enough insulin. It can be managed with lifestyle changes, oral
            medications, and in some cases, insulin therapy.

          <h3>Gestational Diabetes</h3>
          <p>
            Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and usually resolves
            after childbirth. It is characterized by high blood sugar levels
            that develop during pregnancy in women who did not have diabetes
            before. Gestational diabetes increases the risk of complications
            during pregnancy and delivery, and it may also increase the risk of
            Type 2 diabetes in both the mother and child.
